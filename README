Turn based RPG - CSCI 41 Version

One letter grade is available for each of these bullet points implemented. If
you do only part of a bullet point, you will get a half grade.

Words in all caps are the things you will be graded on. Everything else is a
detail that you can change however you want.

1) Must have a FUNCTIONAL WORLD MAP that shows a view of the game world.
Must be able to WALK the heroes around the world map and PICK UP TREASURE,
BOUNCE OFF OBSTACLES, and FIGHT monsters by walking over them.
You must be able to BEAT THE GAME.

2) Must have a class for HEROES and MONSTERS, using PROPER CLASS DESIGN and INHERITANCE.
Must have things like health, attack value, defense value, special abilities, and SPEED.
You can design these things however you want, only SPEED is required. You must
build a class hierarchy as such: Base Class for all Actors in the world,
subclassed for heroes and monsters, subclassed for different kinds of heroes
and monsters. 
               Actors
        |--------|--------|
      Heroes           Monsters
	  --|---           ---|----
      |    |          |   |   |
	Rogue Fighter  Goblin Orc Kerney

The exact details are up to you, these are just examples.

3) All heroes & monsters must be held in a DATA STRUCTURE of some sort using
smart pointers so that it does not slice the Actors. You Must LOAD
heroes, monsters, and state of the world at launch, and SAVE it at program quit.
You must write a New Game function that will reset the world to the start.

4) When walking over a monster, switch to a combat screen. Must use a circular
linked list to keep track of whose turn it is. They will be originally
inserted into the CIRCULAR LINKED LIST in order of their SPEED stat. In other
words, if you have the following heroes: Bob (Speed 10), Cindy (Speed 15),
Charlie (Speed 8), and the following monsters: Leila (Speed 12), Johnson
(Speed 9), and Cthulu (Speed 1), then the circular linked list will look like
this at the beginning of the combat:
Cindy, Leila, Bob, Johnson, Charlie, Cthulu

So Cindy will go first, followed by Leila, followed by Bob, etc. Once Cthulu
goes, then it is Cindy's turn again.

When someone is killed in combat, you can either delete them from the circular
linked list, or you can mark them as dead, and then just skip their turn. End
combat once all heroes or monsters are dead.

5) You must visualize the turn order using BRIDGES. Look at the bridges_demo
directory on instructions on getting set up with BRIDGES and sample code.

Extra Credit:
1) Theme / doing super cool awesome stuff
2) Cover Art and Music - You have to *make it yourself*, you can't just copy it
from soundcloud or something. Post music on YouTube and attach art to Canvas
submission. It has to be at least somewhat good. Kinda. I don't have huge
standards but come on.

When you submit on Canvas, tell me what bullet points you did and link the
music and art if you did that.
